<h1>Project 3: Memory Management</h1> 
</font> 
</center> 

<h2>Important Dates</h2> 

<p><b>Questions about the project?</b> Send them to <code>537-help@cs.wisc.edu</code> .</p> 

<p><b>Due:</b> <strike>Wednesday 10/23</strike> Friday 10/25 by whenever.</p> 

<h2>Overview</h2> 

<p>There are two parts to this project:
<ul>
<li><a href=p3a.html>Memory Allocation Library:</a> to be done on the mumble lab,
so you can learn more about programming in C on a typical UNIX-based platform (Linux)</li> 
<li><a href=p3b.html>The Null Pointer and Other Tricks:</a> to be done in our xv6
hacking environment.</li> 
</ul> 
</p> 

<p>Click on the above links to learn more about what you should do. READ EACH CAREFULLY!</p> 

<h2>Notes</h2> 

<p><b>This project can be done with a single partner.</b> Copying code (from
other groups) is considered cheating. Read <a href=../dontcheat.html>this</a> for
more info on what is OK and what is not!</p> 

<h2>Handing It In</h2> 

<p>The handin directory is <code>~cs537-SECTION/handin/login/p3</code> where <code>
login</code> is your login and <code>SECTION</code> is your section (i.e., 2 or 3).</p> 

<p>For the C/Linux part of this project, you should turn in whatever
is needed to build <code>libmem.so</code> , including a makefile.</p> 

<p>For the xv6 part of the project, copy all of your source files (but not .o
files, please, or binaries!) into the <code>xv6/</code> subdirectory of your p3
directory. A simple way to do this is to copy everything into the destination
directory directory, then type <code>make</code> to make sure it builds, and then
type <code>make clean</code> to remove unneeded files.</p> 

<p>Finally, into your p3 directory, please make a README file. In there,
describe what you did a little bit. The most important bit, at the top,
however, should be the authorship of the project, particularly if you had a
partner. Include both partner's names and CS logins to receive credit; please
put the README in BOTH partners' directories; put the code in just one.</p>
