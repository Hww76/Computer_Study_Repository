<h2>Important Dates</h2> 

<p><b>Questions about the project?</b> Send them to <code>537-help@cs.wisc.edu</code> .</p> 

<p><b>Due:</b> Friday 12/13 by whenever.</p> 

<h2>Overview</h2> 

<p>There are two parts to this project:
<ul>
<li><a href=p5a.html>Network File Server:</a> to be done on the mumble lab,
so you can learn more about programming in C on a typical UNIX-based platform (Linux)</li> 
<li><a href=p5b.html>File System Integrity:</a> to be done in the xv6 hacking environment.</li> 
</ul> 
</p> 

<p>Click on the above links to learn more about what you should do. READ EACH CAREFULLY!</p> 

<h2>Notes</h2> 

<p><b>This project, like all others this semester, can be done with a single
partner.</b> Copying code (from other groups) is considered cheating. Read
<a href=../dontcheat.html>this</a> for more info on what is OK and what is not!

<h2>Handing It In</h2> 

<p>The handin directory is <code>~cs537-2/handin/login/p5</code> where <code>login</code> is
your login.</p> 

<p>For the C/Linux part of this project, you should copy whatever
is needed to build the web server (including a makefile) into the <code>
linux/</code> subdirectory.</p> 

<p>For the xv6 part of the project, copy all of your source files (but not .o
files, please, or binaries!) into the <code>xv6/</code> subdirectory of your p5
directory. A simple way to do this is to copy everything into the destination
directory directory, then type <code>make</code> to make sure it builds, and then
type <code>make clean</code> to remove unneeded files.</p> 

<p>Finally, into your p5 directory, please include a README file. In there,
describe what you did a little bit.</p>
