<h2>Important Dates</h2> 

<p><b>Due:</b> Monday, 9/16, by 9pm (or so).</p> 

<h2>Questions?</h2> 

<p>Send questions to <b>537-help@cs.wisc.edu</b> (or, of course, visit us in
person during office hours!). If the question is about your code, hand in all
of your code and include your login in your email (you are free to modify the
contents of your handin directory prior to the due date). Also include all
other relevant information, such as cutting and pasting what you typed and the
results from the screen. In general, the more information you give, the more
we can help!</p> 

<h2>Overview</h2> 

<p>There are two parts to this project:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2013/Projects/p1a.html">Sorting:</a> to be done on the mumble lab, so you can
learn more about programming in C on a typical UNIX-based platform (Linux)</li> 
<li><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2013/Projects/p1b.html">Kernel Intro:</a> to be done in our xv6 hacking
environment, so you can learn more about what actually goes on in a real
kernel.</li> 
</ul> 
<p></p> 

<p>Click on the above links to learn more about what you should do. READ EACH
CAREFULLY! Note: it will take a long time to read each and really make sure
not to miss anything.</p> 

<h2>Notes</h2> 

<p>Before beginning, <b>read
<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/lab-tutorial.pdf">this tutorial.</a> </b> 
It has some useful tips for programming in the C environment.</p> 

<p>
<b>Read K+R (the course textbook on C)</b> as it is a great
introduction to the language. Familiarizing yourself with these topics will
help you complete the programming projects:
</p><ul>
<li>character arrays, null terminated strings, character pointers (1.9, 5.5, 5.10)</li> 
<li>pointer arithmetic (also called address arithmetic) (5.4)</li> 
<li>using array notation on pointers and vice-versa (5.3)</li> 
<li>pointer arrays (5.6)</li> 
<li>function pointers (pointers to functions) (5.11, 5.12)</li> 
<li>external declarations and the difference between definition and
declaration (4.3, 4.4, A8)</li> 
<li>preprocessor file inclusion (#include) and macro substitution (#define)
(for constant style definitions) (4.5, 4.11)</li> 
</ul> 
These topics highlight the main differences between C and other languages like
Java. They are generally what cause issues for programmers new to C.
<p></p> 


<p><b>This project, unlike all others this semester, must be done alone.</b> 
Note that it is always OK to talk to others about your code, as well as
help them debug their code. Copying code, however, is considered
cheating. Don't do it! How will you learn that way? Read
<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2013/dontcheat.html">this</a> for more info on what is OK and what is not.</p> 

<p>One last point about this project: if you don't have a partner for the next
project, <b>we will use the score from this one to match you up with someone
who performed similarly.</b> Thus, if you are looking for a project partner, your
score on P1 is particularly important! Work hard and get a good score; there
is no reason you should not be able to get 100 on this project.</p> 

<h2>Handing It In</h2> 

<p>For the C/Linux part of this project (sorting), you should turn in one
file, called <code>fastsort.c</code> . We will compile it in the following way: </p><blockquote>
<code>shell% gcc -O -Wall -o fastsort fastsort.c</code> </blockquote> so make sure it compiles in
such a manner. You should copy this file into your handin directory into the
subdirectory called <code>linux</code> .<p></p> 

<p>The handin directory (for Section 2) is <code>~cs537-2/handin/login/p1</code> 
where <code>login</code> is your login; for Section 3, it is the same but with a 3
(not a 2). For example, Remzi's login is <code>remzi</code> , and thus he would copy
his beautiful code into <code>~cs537-2/handin/remzi/p1</code> . Copying of these
files is accomplished with the <code>cp</code> program, as follows: </p><blockquote><pre>shell%
cp fastsort.c ~cs537-2/handin/remzi/p1/linux/</pre> </blockquote> <p></p> 

<p>For the xv6 part of the project, copy all of your source files (but not .o
files, please, or binaries!) into the <code>xv6/</code> subdirectory of your p1
directory. A simple way to do this is to copy everything into the destination
directory, then type <code>make</code> to make sure it builds, and then
type <code>make clean</code> to remove unneeded files.</p> 

<p>
</p><blockquote><pre>shell% cp -r . ~cs537-2/handin/remzi/p1/xv6
shell% cd ~cs537-2/handin/remzi/p1/xv6
shell% make
shell% make clean
</pre> </blockquote> 

<p></p> 

<p>Finally, into your p1 directory, please make a README file. In there,
describe what you did a little bit. The most important bit, at the top,
however, should be the authorship of the project.</p>
