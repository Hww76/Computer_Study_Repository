<h2>Important Dates And Notes</h2> 

<p><b>Questions about the project?</b> Send them to <code>537-help@cs.wisc.edu</code> .</p> 

<p><b>Due: <b>Wed 10/02</b> by 9pm.</b> 

<p><b>You are allowed to have ONE partner for this project.</b> Copying code
(from other groups) is considered <a href=../dontcheat.html>cheating.</a> </p> 

<h2>Overview</h2> 

<p>There are two parts to this project:
<ul>
<li><a href=p2a.html>Shell:</a> to be done on the mumble lab, so you can
learn more about programming in C on a typical UNIX-based platform (Linux)</li> 
<li><a href=p2b.html>Scheduling:</a> to be done in our xv6 OS hacking
environment.</li> 
</ul> 
</p> 

<p>Click on the above links to learn more about what you should do. READ EACH CAREFULLY!</p> 

<h2>Notes</h2> 

<p>None (yet).</p> 

<h2>Handing It In</h2> 

<p>The handin directory is <code>~cs537-XXX/handin/login/p2</code> where <code>login</code> is
your login and XXX is the section you are in.</p> 

<p>For the C/Linux part of this project (the shell), you should turn in one
file, called <code>mysh.c</code> . You should copy this file into your handin
directory into the subdirectory called <code>linux</code> . If you have a partner,
only put the code in ONE of your directories. You should also include a simple
<b>makefile</b> , so we can simply type <code>make</code> and build your testable
binary. The binary should be named <code>mysh</code> .</p> 

<p>For the xv6 part of the project, copy all of your source files (but not .o
files, please, or binaries!) into the <code>xv6/</code> subdirectory of your p2
directory. A simple way to do this is to copy everything into the destination
directory directory, then type <code>make</code> to make sure it builds, and then
type <code>make clean</code> to remove unneeded files.</p> 

<p>Finally, into your p2 directory, please make a README file. In there,
describe what you did a little bit. The most important bit, at the top,
however, should be the authorship of the project, particularly if you had a
partner. Include both partner's names and CS logins to receive credit.</p>
